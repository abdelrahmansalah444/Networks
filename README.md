Packet Tracer Enterprise Topology

🚀 This repository contains a networking project built in Cisco Packet Tracer, simulating an enterprise-level topology with multiple services and protocols.


---

🔹 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how different network services and protocols work together to create a scalable, automated, and stable enterprise network.
The topology includes:

DNS Server → Resolves hostnames to IPs and hosts a custom website.

DHCP Server → Provides dynamic IP addressing for clients.

OSPF Protocol → Ensures dynamic routing between routers.

STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) → Prevents loops and adds redundancy in the switching layer.

🔹 Features

Custom website hosted on the DNS/Web server with multiple pages:

Home Page (introduction)
